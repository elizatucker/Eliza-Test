      <h2>First, who is Jeff Goldblum?</h2>
        <h3>Jeff Goldblum is an actor, musician, and all-around ccool guy. Born on Oct. 22, 1952, Goldblum grew up in Pennsylvania and always showed an interest in show business. He moved to New York City at 17 years old, where he began his now legendery career in acting. You may have seen him in hit movies such as "Jurassic Park," "The Fly," or "The Grand Budapest Hotel." You may not have seen him in lesser movies, such as "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension," "Earth Girls are Easy," or my personal least-favorite, "Independence Day."</h3>
